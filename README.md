<h3>About</h3>
You play in first person view equipped with only a flashlight and have to navigate a maze to reach the goal. All whilst being chased by a T-posing Maynard that knows your exact location at all times.
Your flashlight has a very short battery life so there are batteries littered across the map that refill the bar slightly and also point to in the direction of the goal. Additionally, there is a warning 
system that lets you know how close the Maynard is to you. The only way to deter it is to shine the flashlight in its direction and stopping it from advancing and with a 20 percent chance of teleporting away.
Aim of the game is to reach the goal before you are caught ending the game. You are highly incentized to not get caught. :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
